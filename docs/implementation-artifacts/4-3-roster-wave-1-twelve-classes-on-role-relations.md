# Story 4.3: Roster wave 1 — twelve classes on role relations

Status: done

## Story

As a player,
I want new classes to draft, held together by readable role matchups,
so that drafting gets deeper without an N-squared rules explosion.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Roles replace the RPS tables (AD-4 amendment, FR14).** A 7-role vocabulary (Vanguard, Skirmisher, Sniper, Artillery, Support, Control, Brute) + a role-relation table land in versioned balance data and become the SINGLE matchup source. `rpsBeats`/`rpsHunts` are **deleted** — no dual matchup tables survive. The damage pipeline's advantage/disadvantage lookup and the draft card's `beats`/`beatenBy` both derive from role relations. **Continuity (FR14 degenerate case):** mapping the six shipped classes to their roles reproduces today's effective matchups EXACTLY (mage→knight, knight→archer, archer→mage symmetric; archer→cleric, archer→witch one-way hunts) — proven by test.
2. **The wave-1 small roster ships (dossier §1).** The **5 new small classes** — Berserker, Phalanx, Ninja, Valkyrie, Sorceress — ship as role/stat variants ("start generic, iterate to unique"): each with a `role`, a full FR15 stat row, `sizeClass: 'small'`, and a 3-letter code, all in balance data. First-level classes only (D-0a: no promotion this era). The six shipped rows are UNCHANGED (continuity). **Golem is NOT in this story** — it ships in 4.8 with its two-cell footprint semantics (dossier §1 sweep note; §2). Mage keeps engine key `mage` but displays as **Wizard / WIZ** (D-1d, display-only shell rename).
3. **Every class renders the FR2 improved spec card (UX-DR3).** Role, matchups (beats / weak-vs, derived from role relations), per-row behavior, and action counts — readable at 360px. The Draft class picker accommodates all 11 classes (see the layout note — this is a real rework, not a constant bump).
4. **Balance discipline (AD-8).** `balanceVersion` bumps once with hash re-pin and re-recorded goldens; the AI `STRATEGY_POOL` covers the newcomers; the NFR4 sweep runs BOTH modes with no archetype over the ≤65% band; `docs/rules.md` and Help absorb the 11-class table (the 2.4 drift guard `rules-doc.test.ts` stays green). NO `logVersion` change (4.2 spent the era's single bump — AD-15).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Engine — the role vocabulary + relation model replaces RPS (AC: 1)**
  - [x] `balance.ts`: add `ALL_ROLES = ['vanguard','skirmisher','sniper','artillery','support','control','brute'] as const` → `Role` (house const-array pattern, mirror `ALL_TACTICS`). Home: `balance.ts` or `types.ts` — match where `SpellKind`/closed sets live.
  - [x] `ClassStats` gains `role: Role`. Populate all six shipped classes per dossier §1 table (knight=vanguard, mercenary=skirmisher, archer=sniper, mage=artillery, cleric=support, witch=control).
  - [x] Add a `roleRelations` structure to `BalanceData` that expresses the dossier §1 table: Artillery→Vanguard **symmetric** (×3/2 attacker, ×3/4 the reverse), Vanguard→Sniper symmetric, Sniper→Artillery symmetric, Sniper→Support **one-way** ×3/2 (no reverse penalty), Sniper→Control one-way ×3/2. Skirmisher and Brute carry NO relations. Design the shape so a symmetric edge and a one-way hunt are both expressible without a second table (that duality is exactly what `rpsBeats`+`rpsHunts` did — collapse it into one).
  - [x] **DELETE `rpsBeats` and `rpsHunts`** (interface `balance.ts:55,62` + values `:110-111`).
  - [x] `resolve.ts:416-424` `damagePipeline`: replace the `rpsBeats[attacker]===defender || rpsHunts...` advantage test and the `rpsBeats[defender]===attacker` disadvantage test with role-relation lookups reading `BALANCE.classes[attacker].role` / `[defender].role`. Preserve the FR14-amendment asymmetry EXACTLY: advantage from a symmetric edge OR a one-way hunt; disadvantage from the SYMMETRIC edge ALONE (a hunted Support/Control gets NO reverse penalty). Keep the fixed pipeline order (base → preRps → RPS → weaken → clamp) and integer `Ratio` math.
  - [x] `test/combat.test.ts` + `test/roster.test.ts`: continuity assertions — for every ordered pair of the six shipped classes, the role-derived multiplier equals the pre-4.3 `rpsBeats`/`rpsHunts` result (pin the degenerate case). Add coverage for at least one NEW relation pair (e.g. berserker=Vanguard beats archer=Sniper; sorceress=Artillery beats knight=Vanguard).
- [x] **Task 2: Engine — the 5 new small classes (AC: 2)**
  - [x] `types.ts:16` `ALL_CLASSES`: append `'berserker','phalanx','ninja','valkyrie','sorceress'` (closed-set edit — the sanctioned API-change process; the `UnitClass` union derives). Order after the shipped six.
  - [x] `balance.ts` `BALANCE.classes`: add the 5 rows EXACTLY per dossier §1 table (HP/STR/VIT/INT/MEN/AGI/DEX/actions/role/`sizeClass:'small'`). Berserker & Phalanx = Vanguard; Ninja & Valkyrie = Skirmisher; Sorceress = Artillery.
  - [x] **Behavior dispatch:** the engine selects a unit's action by class today (knight/mercenary melee, archer ranged, mage blast, cleric heal, witch cast — see `resolve.ts` `act()`/`strike`/blast/cast and the `CLASS_MOVE_KIND` map at `resolve.ts:~314`). Route the newcomers to their role's GENERIC behavior ("start generic", dossier §1 — the unique moves/Guard are story 4.7): Berserker/Phalanx → melee (like knight); Ninja/Valkyrie → melee (like mercenary, neutral); Sorceress → row-blast (like mage). `CLASS_MOVE_KIND` gains BER/PHA/NIN/VAL = `slash`, SOR = `blast`.
  - [x] `names.ts` `CLASS_SEX`: add the 5 (D-1f — berserker/phalanx/ninja = m; valkyrie/sorceress = f). TS forces this once `ALL_CLASSES` grows.
  - [x] `test/roster.test.ts` + `test/balance.test.ts`: stat-row pins for the newcomers; behavior tests proving each new class acts per its role (a Sorceress blasts a row; a Berserker melees the nearest reachable row).
- [x] **Task 3: Balance version + goldens (AC: 4)**
  - [x] `balance.ts` `version` 3 → 4; `test/balance-hash.test.ts`: add the `4: '<new hash>'` entry (run once to learn the hash — the structural contiguity test enforces it).
  - [x] Re-record goldens ONCE (`vitest -u`) AFTER Tasks 1–2 stable. Existing golden armies are shipped-six only, so verdicts should be IDENTICAL except the balanceVersion field — CONFIRM the diff is version-only (a combat-number change means the continuity refactor broke something). Consider adding one golden that fields a newcomer to lock its behavior.
  - [x] NO `logVersion` change (AD-15 — 4.2 was the era's only bump). `events.test.ts` LOG_VERSION pin stays 4.
- [x] **Task 4: Engine — the AI drafts the newcomers (AC: 4)**
  - [x] `ai.ts` `STRATEGY_POOL`: extend/re-author archetypes so the newcomers appear in the pool (FR25 coverage). Keep each archetype's identity; the tuples are already length-5 (4.2).
  - [x] `test/sim.test.ts`: the both-mode ≤65% band MUST hold over the 11-class meta. Budget real sweep time — new classes change matchups. Re-tune the POOL (placements/comps), NOT class stats, if a comp dominates. Record the wardens-melee-floor watch (3.0) and the **Ninja AGI 28 > Witch 26** tuning question (dossier §1 note) — AGI's pre-4.6 effect is turn-order tie-break only (crit/dodge is 4.6), so note it for the sweep rather than acting on it.
- [x] **Task 5: Shell — display rename + the FR2 card + the 11-class picker (AC: 2, 3)**
  - [~] **Sprites — the units sheet must grow from 6 to 11 frames (asset work, FR31).** `sprites.ts` `UNIT_FRAMES` is `Record<UnitClass,number>` → adding classes is a compile error until the 5 new frames exist. The sheet is ONE 192×32 texture (six 32×32 CC0 Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup tiles in ALL_CLASSES order). Source 5 more CC0 DCSS tiles for Berserker/Phalanx/Ninja/Valkyrie/Sorceress, extend the sheet to 352×32 (11 frames), update `UNIT_FRAMES` (6–10), the `BootScene` load frame config, and `src/assets/attribution.ts` provenance. **NOT DONE — INTERIM instead (review correction, 2026-07-18):** the 5 newcomers reuse existing frames (Berserker/Phalanx→Knight, Ninja/Valkyrie→Mercenary, Sorceress→Wizard); the sheet is still 6 frames, `BootScene`'s guard was reworked to tolerate this, and `attribution.ts` documents each reuse as INTERIM. Danilo's device veto on dedicated tiles is still open (see open question 3) — accepted to ship interim per his 2026-07-18 review call.
  - [x] `constants.ts` `CLASS_ABBREVIATIONS`: `mage: 'MAG'` → `'WIZ'` (D-1d); add `berserker:'BER', phalanx:'PHA', ninja:'NIN', valkyrie:'VAL', sorceress:'SOR'`. `Record<UnitClass,...>` forces the 5 new entries.
  - [x] Display name: `mage` must read "Wizard" on cards/narration (engine key unchanged). Add a shell-side `CLASS_DISPLAY_NAME` lookup (or extend `CLASS_TEXT`) — do NOT rename the engine key (would orphan pre-era history rendering, D-1d). The draft card uses `card.name.toUpperCase()`; route it through the display name.
  - [x] `draftModel.ts` `CLASS_TEXT`: add role/behavior prose for the 5 newcomers; update `classRulesCard` `beats`/`beatenBy` derivation (`:49,54`) to read ROLE RELATIONS, not `BALANCE.rpsBeats` (which is gone). `beats`/`beatenBy` become role-derived class lists (a Vanguard may beat multiple Snipers now — the card copy must handle a set, not a single class).
  - [x] **DraftScene picker layout — scrollable, built to SCALE (PO decision 2026-07-18).** `buildClassCards` (`:71-84`) is a 2-col × N-row grid of 168×74 cards; 6 classes end at y≈312, but 11 reach y≈484, colliding with the tray (y=360) and Continue (y=470). Rework it with the house scroll helper (`enableDragScroll`, used by HistoryScene/Help) — a SCROLLABLE picker, because the roster keeps growing (Golem in 4.8, then dragons/beasts + slayer classes in a later wave; Danilo: "we are going to have monsters, so we should think about this"). Build for a growing list, not just 11. Keep FR2 readability at 360px (UX-DR3) and ≥44px tap targets (UX-DR4). Dev's call on the exact scroll layout — NO blocking DESIGN/EXPERIENCE amendment session now (lower priority per PO); a light spine note documenting the scrollable picker is enough. Confirm on device.
- [x] **Task 6: Docs — rules.md + Help absorb the roster (AC: 4)**
  - [x] `docs/rules.md`: extend the class table to 11 classes and rewrite the matchup prose from the triangle to the role vocabulary. `rules-doc.test.ts` derives from balance and will FAIL until the doc matches (the 2.4 drift guard working as designed).
  - [x] `HelpScene.ts`: absorb the 11-class content; verify it renders at 360px (it may share the picker's scroll rework).
- [x] **Task 7: Gate + device sign-off (all ACs)**
  - [x] Full gate: typecheck, lint, prettier, all tests incl. re-recorded goldens + both-mode sweep, engine coverage ≥90%.
  - [x] Deploy; Danilo's device session: draft the newcomers, read the FR2 cards, confirm the picker scrolls/reads at 360px, WIZ shows for Mage, a full 5-slot loop with mixed new/old classes completes. Quote his sign-off verbatim.

### Review Findings

- [x] [Review][Decision] Archer's own detail card never shows a "strong vs" chip for its hunts against Support/Control — `ROLE_DAMAGE_TYPE` (apps/web/src/scenes/DraftScene.ts:35) has no entry for `support`/`control`, so the `sniper→support`/`sniper→control` hunt relations (packages/engine/src/balance.ts:138-142) produce no chip on Archer's own card (only the reverse "weak to projectiles" shows on Cleric/Witch). **Resolved by Danilo (2026-07-18):** fall back to the role name itself (e.g. "strong vs Support, Control") when no damage-type label exists — converted to a patch below.
- [x] [Review][Decision] 4 of 5 new classes render pixel-identical to existing ones (Berserker/Phalanx share Knight frame 0, Ninja/Valkyrie share Mercenary frame 1 — apps/web/src/config/sprites.ts:28-32) and Task 5's "sheet must grow to 11 frames" subtask is checked `[x]` despite this. **Resolved by Danilo (2026-07-18):** ship the interim reuse as-is (device veto on real tiles still pending per open question 3); fix the Task 5 checkbox to reflect what was actually built — converted to a patch below.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Generic role-relation contradiction invariant deleted without an equivalent — the old test asserted structurally (over `Object.entries(BALANCE.rpsHunts)`) that no relation hunts back or contradicts the triangle; the replacement tests (packages/engine/test/balance.test.ts:83-116) only pin the current 5-entry array and specific pairs. No test would catch a future contradictory `roleRelations` entry (e.g. story 4.7+). Add a generic structural test over `BALANCE.roleRelations` mirroring the deleted invariant.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Role/action summary line has no `wordWrap`, unlike the sibling behavior line below it — apps/web/src/scenes/DraftScene.ts:161-167 renders `${card.role}  ·  act ${a.front}/${a.mid}/${a.back}` unwrapped while the next line explicitly sets `wordWrap: { width: textW }` "to clear the button column" (comment at line 156). Berserker's role text "Vanguard bruiser" is the longest in the roster and risks running under the Add-to-army button column. Apply the same `textW` wrap.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `attribution.ts` `classSources` values embed non-path annotation text — the field is documented as "source tile path inside the pack" but interim entries read `'dc-mon/vault_guard.png (INTERIM: shares the Knight tile)'` (apps/web/src/assets/attribution.ts:57-61). `attribution.test.ts` only asserts truthiness, not path shape, so the drifted contract is unguarded ahead of the planned Credits screen (story 2.4) rendering this raw string. Split the interim note out of the path value (e.g. a separate `note` field) or tighten the doc comment to allow annotated strings.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `docs/rules.md` role list formatting inconsistency — Vanguard/Skirmisher/Sniper/Artillery each get their own bullet line, but Support and Control are crammed onto one shared line (`- **Support** — Cleric · **Control** — Witch`, docs/rules.md:33). Split into two bullets to match the pattern.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Test-suite timeout margin tightened by the heavier 11-class sweep — `sim.test.ts`'s both-mode/determinism checks and one `combat.test.ts` property test timed out under full parallel `pnpm -w test` load at the default 5000ms (all pass cleanly in isolation with more headroom). Not a functional bug, but worth a `testTimeout` bump on the affected files before this flakes in CI.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Archer's own card shows no "strong vs" chip for hunts against Support/Control — fall back to the role name when `ROLE_DAMAGE_TYPE` has no entry for the defender's role (e.g. "strong vs Support, Control"), instead of silently dropping the chip. apps/web/src/scenes/DraftScene.ts:35,177-193. (Decision: Danilo, 2026-07-18.)
- [x] [Review][Patch] Task 5's sprite subtask is checked `[x]` despite 4/5 newcomers reusing existing frames (interim, device veto pending) — correct the checkbox to reflect the actual interim state rather than "done." docs/implementation-artifacts/4-3-roster-wave-1-twelve-classes-on-role-relations.md:51. (Decision: Danilo, 2026-07-18 — ship interim as-is.)
- [x] [Review][Defer] `card.beats`/`card.beatenBy` computed by `classRulesCard` but never consumed by `DraftScene` [apps/web/src/flow/draftModel.ts:61-62] — deferred, pre-existing pattern (dead field, harmless: both derivations ultimately read the same `BALANCE.roleRelations`, no drift risk; only exercised by `draft-model.test.ts`)
- [x] [Review][Defer] `chip()` matchup-pill layout has no width/right-edge bounds check [apps/web/src/scenes/DraftScene.ts:126] — deferred, forward risk only (currently safe with one damage-type string per side; a future role/type combination with a longer list could run off the 360px canvas)
- [x] [Review][Defer] `sprites.test.ts` hardcodes an untracked `SHEET_FRAMES = 6` constant [apps/web/test/sprites.test.ts:695-712] — deferred, pre-existing test-authoring pattern (duplicates knowledge already implicit in the sheet dimensions; nothing forces it to bump when the sheet extends to 11 frames)

## Dev Notes

### The dossier is the spec — this story implements §1 (roles, relations, roster) verbatim

`docs/planning-artifacts/epic-4-dossier/DOSSIER.md §1` — signed off 2026-07-17 (D-1a…D-1f). Do not re-litigate. The §1 table's stat rows are TUNING DRAFTS, sweep-policed here (AC4). If implementation reveals a design hole, STOP and surface it.

### ⚠️ SCOPE CONFLICT to resolve (epics vs dossier) — flagged, see open questions

The **epics.md AC (line 741) says "4 new small classes"** but the **dossier §1 table + gender split (D-1f) define 5**: Berserker, Phalanx, Ninja, Valkyrie, Sorceress. The dossier is authoritative (the "dossier is the spec" precedent from 4.2), and its sweep note (§1, line 78) says "4.3 for the 11 smalls" — 6 shipped + 5 new = 11. **This story is scoped to 5 new smalls.** The epics text is an undercount to correct on the next PM touch.

### Golem is DEFERRED to 4.8 — do NOT add it here

The roster is 12 (11 smalls + Golem) but wave-1 sequencing splits it: the dossier §1 sweep note is explicit — "4.3 for the 11 smalls, 4.8 for Golem comps." Golem is a 2-slot monster whose two-cell footprint/targeting semantics (§2) don't exist until 4.8; adding its balance row now would make it draftable with undefined targeting = broken battles. Leave `golem` out of `ALL_CLASSES` and `BALANCE.classes` this story.

### The refactor's heart: one matchup source, exact continuity

The single biggest risk is breaking the shipped six's matchups during the RPS→role migration. Current state (READ before editing):
- **`resolve.ts:416-424` `damagePipeline`** — the ONLY combat consumer. `advantage = rpsBeats[att]===def || rpsHunts[att]?.includes(def)`; `disadvantage = rpsBeats[def]===att` (symmetric triangle only — the hunts deliberately grant NO reverse penalty, `resolve.ts:411-414`). Your role lookup must reproduce this asymmetry: symmetric edges give both ×3/2 and the ×3/4 reverse; one-way hunt edges give ×3/2 with NO reverse.
- **`draftModel.ts:49,54` `classRulesCard`** — the only card consumer. `beats: rpsBeats[cls]`, `beatenBy = find(att => rpsBeats[att]===cls)`. After the refactor both derive from role relations. A Vanguard now beats every Sniper, so `beats`/`beatenBy` are LISTS, not single classes — the card copy at `DraftScene.ts:94` (`beats ${card.beats}`) must render a set.
- **Continuity map (dossier §1):** knight=Vanguard, mercenary=Skirmisher, archer=Sniper, mage=Artillery, cleric=Support, witch=Control. Under this map the role table reproduces the exact `{mage→knight, knight→archer, archer→mage}` triangle + `{archer→[cleric,witch]}` hunts. Pin it with a test over all 36 ordered shipped-six pairs.

### New-class behavior is role-generic this story (moves/Guard are 4.7)

The engine dispatches action by class (`resolve.ts` `act()` + `CLASS_MOVE_KIND` at `~314`). "Start generic" (dossier §1/§4, D-2b): Berserker/Phalanx melee like Knight (Vanguard), Ninja/Valkyrie melee like Mercenary (Skirmisher, neutral), Sorceress row-blasts like Mage (Artillery). Phalanx's Guard and Wizard/Sorceress Staff-Attack are the story-4.7 move table — NOT here. `CLASS_MOVE_KIND`: BER/PHA/NIN/VAL=`slash`, SOR=`blast`.

### Display rename: Mage → Wizard is SHELL-ONLY (D-1d)

Engine key stays `mage` (renaming orphans pre-era history rendering). Shell changes: `CLASS_ABBREVIATIONS.mage` MAG→WIZ, and a display-name lookup so cards/narration read "Wizard". Board keeps codes (now WIZ). Cite `// D-1d: display rename only` at the code site.

### THE COUPLING FLAG (the story-4.2 lesson, applied): every roster-sized surface

Growing `ALL_CLASSES` 6→11 ripples to every `Record<UnitClass,...>` (TS finds these — `CLASS_ABBREVIATIONS`, `CLASS_SEX`, `CLASS_TEXT`, sprite atlas keys) AND every scene that lays out per-class UI. The known layout hazard: **DraftScene's picker grid overflows at 11 classes** (2-col × 168×74 → y≈484 vs the 360 base; Task 5). Also verify: sprite assets exist for the 5 new classes (`addUnitSprite(cls)` — check the atlas; missing art is a blocker, and DESIGN's zero-custom-art constraint (FR31) means CC0/free packs only). See memory: army-row scenes are coupling sites — grep every comp/roster-rendering surface, don't trust a task list.

### Previous-story intelligence (4.2, just shipped 4cec830)

- The 4.2 senior review caught HistoryScene's 5-unit overflow the recon map missed — apply that vigilance to the picker/Help here.
- House flow: deploy → Danilo device-checks → quote verbatim (device sign-off gates `done`).
- Balance-hash test is the contiguity guard; goldens re-record ONCE at the end; `?perf=1` sampler if the scene feels heavy.
- Sweep re-tuning is whack-a-mole by hand — 4.2 used a deterministic hill-climb over identity-preserving pool variants (scratchpad scripts, uncommitted). Budget real time (AC4).

### Project Structure Notes

- MODIFIED (engine): `types.ts` (ALL_CLASSES, maybe ALL_ROLES), `balance.ts` (roles, roleRelations, 5 rows, delete rps, version 4), `resolve.ts` (damagePipeline + behavior dispatch + CLASS_MOVE_KIND), `names.ts` (CLASS_SEX), `index.ts` (export Role/roleRelations if public) + tests: `balance`, `balance-hash`, `combat`, `roster`, `sim`, `golden` (+ snapshot), possibly `events`/`arbitraries`.
- MODIFIED (web): `config/constants.ts` (codes + display name), `flow/draftModel.ts` (CLASS_TEXT + role-derived card), `scenes/DraftScene.ts` (picker rework), `scenes/HelpScene.ts` (roster content).
- MODIFIED (docs): `docs/rules.md` (11-class table + role prose).
- Sprite atlas: confirm assets for berserker/phalanx/ninja/valkyrie/sorceress (FR31 zero-custom-art).

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Opus 4.8 (claude-opus-4-8[1m]) — main agent, inline. The parallel subagent fleet (4.2's approach for the sweep search) was unavailable this session (org monthly spend limit), so the sweep re-tune ran via inline `tsx` hill-climb scripts (scratchpad, uncommitted — the 4.2 precedent).

### Debug Log References

- **The RPS→role refactor is byte-identical for the shipped six:** the 8 goldens pass UNCHANGED after the refactor, and combat.test's pinned damage numbers hold — the continuity proof (AC1) at both the unit and battle level. `balanceVersion` 3→4, hash re-pinned `6d243f05`; no `logVersion` change (AD-15).
- **Judging-symmetry test generalised (chirality):** arbitraries now generate the newcomers, which surfaced a cross-class AGI tie (Berserker & Wizard both AGI 12) that the symmetry filter — written when every AGI was distinct, so it keyed on same-CLASS — did not exclude. The per-engagement coin flip (`resolve.ts` `tieWinner`) is not side-symmetric, so the filter now excludes same-AGI mirror pairs. Test fix, not an engine bug.
- **The sweep was the hard part (AC4, both-mode ≤65%).** Hand-tuning is whack-a-mole: newcomer-heavy comps are single-mode doormats (melee can't win the ranged race) OR the melee newcomers are wipeout-fragile (Berserker/Ninja HP < Knight/Merc) → either way a doormat inflates the ceiling comps past 65%. Adding 2 new archetypes couldn't get under 65% (best random ~66.5%). The winning approach: **single-unit substitutions** — one newcomer swapped into each of five existing archetypes (bulwark←berserker, wardens←phalanx, cabal←ninja, talons←valkyrie, gale←sorceress), pool size unchanged at 10, no doormats introduced. A `tsx` hill-climb over substitution positions converged to **max 63.3%** (both modes, 15 runs/pairing) — verified in `sim.test`.
- **Sprites are INTERIM (flagged for device veto):** the units sheet still has six CC0 DCSS frames; the 5 newcomers reuse the closest existing frame (Berserker/Phalanx→Knight, Ninja/Valkyrie→Mercenary, Sorceress→Wizard). Dedicated CC0 tiles + sheet extension + attribution are pending Danilo's device review (open question 3). The `sprites`/`attribution` guards were updated to encode this interim state explicitly.

### Completion Notes List

- **AC1 (roles replace RPS):** `ALL_ROLES`/`Role` + `ClassStats.role` + `BalanceData.roleRelations` (5 directed edges, symmetric|hunt) landed; `rpsBeats`/`rpsHunts` DELETED. `resolve.ts` `damagePipeline` derives the multiplier via the new `rpsRatio(attacker, defender)` (single source); the draft card derives `beats`/`beatenBy` via `dealsAdvantage`. Continuity proven: a 36-pair matrix test + the unchanged goldens + unchanged combat numbers.
- **AC2 (5 new smalls):** berserker/phalanx/ninja/valkyrie/sorceress added to `ALL_CLASSES` + `BALANCE.classes` (exact dossier §1 stats, `sizeClass:'small'`, roles). Behavior routed by role in `act`/`misfire` + `CLASS_MOVE_KIND` (Vanguard/Skirmisher melee, Artillery blast). `CLASS_SEX` extended (D-1f). Golem deferred to 4.8. Mage→**Wizard** display-only (`CLASS_ABBREVIATIONS` MAG→WIZ + `CLASS_DISPLAY_NAME`).
- **AC3 (FR2 card + picker):** the Draft picker is now a SCROLLABLE bounded viewport (the Help/History drag pattern, built to scale) with interactive top/bottom masks that also block taps to off-view cards; the army tray + Continue stay fixed below. The card renders role + role-derived matchups (code lists) + behavior + action counts.
- **AC4 (balance discipline):** `balanceVersion` 3→4 + hash re-pin + goldens (unchanged — continuity); the 10-archetype pool covers all 5 newcomers via single-unit subs; both-mode sweep ≤65% (max 63.3%); `docs/rules.md` rewritten (11-class table, role matchups, 11-class speed order) + the drift guard (`rules-doc.test`) re-authored role-based; Help renders it automatically.
- **Full gate green:** typecheck (both packages), eslint + prettier, engine 215 + web 183 tests, engine coverage ≥90%. Device sign-off (open questions 2/3 — picker feel + newcomer sprite-tile veto) is Danilo's next step.

## Context-analysis questions — RESOLVED by Danilo 2026-07-18

1. **5 new classes, not 4 — CONFIRMED.** Scope is the 5 dossier §1 smalls (Berserker, Phalanx, Ninja, Valkyrie, Sorceress); the epics.md "4 new small classes" text is an undercount, flagged for the next PM touch. Golem stays deferred to 4.8.
2. **Scrollable picker, built to scale — DECIDED.** Rework the Draft picker with the `enableDragScroll` house pattern (not a one-off grid tweak) because the roster keeps growing (monsters in 4.8 + a later dragon/beast wave). Dev's call on the exact scroll layout; no blocking UX-amendment session now (lower PO priority) — a light spine note suffices. See Task 5.
3. **Sprite tiles — dev picks, Danilo vetoes on device (names precedent).** Dev sources sensible CC0 DCSS tiles for the 5 archetypes, extends the units sheet to 11 frames + attribution, and shows them at the device review for Danilo's flavor veto (Task 5 sprite subtask).

## Change Log

- 2026-07-18 — Story 4.3 implemented. Role vocabulary (7 roles) + `roleRelations` REPLACE `rpsBeats`/`rpsHunts` as the single FR14 matchup source (AD-4); `rpsRatio`/`dealsAdvantage` engine exports drive combat + the draft card. 5 new small classes (Berserker, Phalanx, Ninja, Valkyrie, Sorceress) on role-generic behavior; Golem deferred to 4.8. Mage→Wizard display rename (D-1d, shell-only). `balanceVersion` 3→4 (hash `6d243f05`), goldens unchanged (shipped-six continuity), NO logVersion change (AD-15). AI pool covers the newcomers via single-unit substitutions into 5 archetypes; both-mode sweep ≤65% (max 63.3%). Draft picker reworked to a scrollable viewport (built to scale). `docs/rules.md` + drift guard rewritten for the 11-class role model. Full gate: 398 tests, engine coverage 99.47%. **Deviations flagged:** (1) INTERIM sprites — the 5 newcomers reuse existing CC0 tiles until dedicated tiles are sourced + veto'd on device (open q3); (2) the sweep re-tune used inline `tsx` hill-climb scripts (uncommitted) as the parallel subagent fleet was unavailable (org spend limit).
- 2026-07-18 — Judging-symmetry property test generalised from same-CLASS to same-AGI mirror-pair exclusion (the wave-1 roster introduced cross-class AGI ties; the coin-flip tie-break is not side-symmetric). Test fix, not an engine change.
- 2026-07-18 — **Draft picker REDESIGNED (supersedes the scrollable-picker plan; Danilo's on-device call).** The scroll felt unintuitive with more units. New design (his mock): a compact ICON GRID — one small tile (sprite + name) per class, all 11 on one screen, no scroll — with tap-to-SELECT (blue highlight) filling a detail panel (sprite, name, role + action counts, behavior, matchup pills) and an explicit **Add to army** button. Scales far better than scroll as the roster grows. Device sign-off: **"it looks great! we can proceed!"**
- 2026-07-18 — Matchups shown by DAMAGE TYPE, not class lists (Danilo): `strong vs` / `weak to` **physical · projectiles · magic** (role→type: Vanguard/Skirmisher=physical, Sniper=projectiles, Artillery=magic; Support/Control untyped), derived from the role relations. Fixes the "long list" problem and reads naturally ("Witch: weak to projectiles").
- 2026-07-18 — Boot fix (caught by the demo, not tests — BootScene is 0%-covered): the sheet-frame guard demanded exactly `ALL_CLASSES.length` (11) frames; it now derives the requirement from `UNIT_FRAMES` (max index + 1 = 6 with interim reuse; auto-tightens to 11 when dedicated tiles land). `sprites.test`'s `< SHEET_FRAMES` assertion now guards this class of bug at the unit level.
